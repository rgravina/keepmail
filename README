======= Keepmail: a mail server which keeps mail instead of sending it ========
===============================================================================

Keepmail keeps copys of mail it recieves, but does not send it on. It is
designed to be used for development and testing of your applications which need
to send email.

The Basics
----------
sudo twistd -ny keepmail.tac

It will bind to port 25 (hence the need to sudo)

TODO
----
- Allow the port to be passed as a parameter

CREDITS

Current code is basically a copy of this example from the Twisted site:
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/mail/documentation/examples/emailserver.tac

In the future, hopefully the code will diverge from this!
